# Hinge It! - The Microsoft Surface Duo game
> This [Xamarin.Forms](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin) Android project is dedicated to the gamification of the [Microsoft Surface Duo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-duo)'s hinge. Be the fastest to hinge / fold the phone into the correct angle.

## Gameplay
The game randomizes an angle value. After the player taps on "Start", the player has to hinge / fold the Microsoft Surface Duo as fast as possible into the target angle.

## Game states

**Mocked**
![Summary](docs/summary.png)

## Open questions
- Is the game playable on an actual device?
- Check for min and max angles of real devices
- Should be the device in an 180Â° position?
- Is the angle treshold of 5 degrees a good choice?
- Do angles of 0 and 360 count as not spanned?

## Simulate hinge angle changes
Use the `Virtual sensors` / `Pressure (hPa)` slider with values from 0 to 360 to simulate a hinge use.
