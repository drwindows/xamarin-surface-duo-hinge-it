# Hinge It! - The Microsoft Surface Duo game
> This [Xamarin.Forms](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin) Android project is dedicated to the gamification of the [Microsoft Surface Duo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-duo)'s hinge. Be the fastest to hinge / fold the phone into the correct angle.

## Caution
Due to the early days of the Surface Duo emulator, the app is missing the hinge angle value reading. You cannot fold your Desktop - hopefully. 

## Gameplay
The game randomizes an angle value. After the player taps on "Start", the player has to hinge / fold the Microsoft Surface Duo as fast as possible into the target angle.

## Game states

I try to update this project with new features until it is actual playable.
